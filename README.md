# Ctxfmt

A program for formatting latex as context based on deepseek

It is compatibility with [Simext](https://github.com/EIPIofficial/Simext).

# Usage

Submit a pdf to deepseek with DeepThink(R1) and let it convert pdf into latex. Create a tex document to copy it.

Run ctxfmt.lua using lua with the format â€œctxfmt.lua [input.tex] [output.tex]".

Add "\environment[...]" to the [output.tex] and run it with context.

The "fig.lua" part has not done yet, so you should add pictures manully.
